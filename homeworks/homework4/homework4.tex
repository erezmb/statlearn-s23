\section{Basic fact about CDFs and quantiles [18 pts]}

In this exercise, we'll walk through a number of basic but important facts about 
quantiles and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). Let $F$ be a CDF, of the
form 
\[
F(x) = \P(X \leq x), \quad x \in \R,
\]
for some real-valued random variable $X$. Let $Q$ be the corresponding quantile 
function,
\[
Q(t) = \inf \{ x : F(x) \geq t \}, \quad t \in [0,1].
\]
(This is often denoted as $Q = F^{-1}$, even when the inverse of $F$ does not
exist in the usual sense.) We note that $F$ is always nondecreasing and 
right-continuous; the latter says, for any $x$,    
\[
F(x) = \lim_{y \to x^+} F(y)
\]
(where $y \to x^+$ means that $y$ approaches $x$ from the right).
% Similarly, $Q$ is always nonincreasing and left-continuous; the latter says, 
% for any $t$,  
% \[
% Q(t) = \lim_{u \to t^-} Q(u)
% \]
% (where $u \to t^-$ means that $u$ approaches $t$ from the left).

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Prove that for any $x$ and any $t$, 
  \marginpar{\small [3 pts]}
  \[
  F(x) \geq t \iff Q(t) \leq x.
  \]
  This is sometimes called the \emph{Galois inequality} for the quantile
  function. Hint: one direction follows from the definition of $Q$, and the
  other is a consequence of right-continuity of $F$.  

\item Use part (a) to prove that if $U \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0,1)$, then $Q(U)$ is
  distributed according to $F$ (which means it has CDF $F$).
  \marginpar{\small [2 pts]}

\item Use part (a) to prove that for any $t$, 
  \marginpar{\small [2 pts]}
  \[
  F(Q(t)) \geq t,
  \]
  with strict inequality if and only if $t$ is not in the range of $F$. 

\item Use parts (b) and (c) to prove that if $X$ is distributed according to
  $F$, then $F(X)$ is sub-uniform, which means that for any $t$, 
  \marginpar{\small [3 pts]}
  \[
  \P(F(X) \leq t) \leq t.
  \]
  with equality $\P(F(X) \leq t) = t$ if and only if $t$ is in the range of
  $F$. Hint: you may start by replacing $X$ with $Q(U)$, for $U \sim
  \mathrm{Unif}(0,1)$, as they have the same distribution.  
  
\item Give a concrete worked example to show when equality fails in the result  
  in part (d).
  \marginpar{\small [2 pts]}

\item Show that we can always achieve equality in part (d) via auxiliary
  randomization: define 
  \[
  F^*(x; v) =  \lim_{y \to x^-} F(y) + v \cdot \Big( F(x) - \lim_{y \to x^-}
  F(y) \Big)
  \]
  (where $y \to x^-$ means that $y$ approaches $x$ from the left), and prove
  that for $V \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0,1)$, independent of $X$, and for any $t$,   
  \marginpar{\small [3 pts]}
  \[
  \P(F^*(X; V) \leq t) = t.
  \]
  Hint: there are different ways to go about this; one way is to show that, with
  respect to the randomness in $(X,V)$ jointly, we can think of $F^*$ as a CDF 
  that is continuous at every point, and hence one for which we always have an
  equality in part (d).

\section{Calibration-conditional beta coverage [18 pts]}

\def\hC{\hat{C}}

Let $D_1$ and $D_2$ be an arbitrary partition of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ into sets of
sizes $n_1=|D_1|$ and $n_2=|D_2|$. Recall, in lecture, we stated that for the
split conformal prediction band \smash{$\hC_n$}, computed on a proper training
set $\{(X_i,Y_i)\}_{i \in D_1}$ and a calibration set $\{(X_i,Y_i)\}_{i \in D_2}$, it
holds that  
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:coverage_beta_split}
\P\Big(Y_{n+1} \in \hC_n(X_{n+1}) \, \Big| \, \{ (X_i,Y_i) \}_{i=1}^n \Big)
\sim \mathrm{Beta}(k_\alpha, n_2+1-k_\alpha), 
\end{equation}
where $k_\alpha = \lceil (1-\alpha)(n_2+1) \rceil$. This assumes that
$(X_i,Y_i)$, $i=1,\dots,n+1$ were all i.i.d.\ draws from some arbitrary
distribution $P$. In what follows, you will work towards a proof of the result
in \eqref{eq:coverage_beta_split}.   

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Let $U_1,\dots,U_n$ be i.i.d.\ from $\mathrm{Unif}(0,1)$, and denote their
  \emph{order statistics} by  
  \[
  U_{(1)} \leq U_{(2)} \leq \cdots \leq U_{(n)}.
  \]
  Fix any $1 \leq k \leq n$. Prove that the density $f_{(k)}$ of $U_{(k)}$ is
  given by 
  \marginpar{\small [4 pts]}
  \[
  f_{(k)}(x) = n {n-1 \choose k-1} x^{k-1} (1-x)^{n-k}.
  \]
  Hint: calculate the probability that $U_{(k)}$ lies in $[x,x+\epsilon]$, then
  send $\epsilon \to 0$.
  
\item From the result in part (a), argue that 
  \marginpar{\small [1 pt]}
  \[
  U_{(k)} \sim \mathrm{Beta}(k, n+1-k).
  \]
  (You just need to recall the form of the beta distribution; you don't need to
  do any hard calculations here.)

\item Now let $X_1,\dots,X_{n+1}$ be i.i.d.\ according to $F$, and assume that
  $F$ is continuous. Prove that 
  \marginpar{\small [3 pts]}
  \[
  \P\big( X_{n+1} \leq X_{(k)} \,|\, X_1,\dots,X_n \big) \sim \mathrm{Beta}(k,
  n+1-k). 
  \]
  Hint: let $U_i = F(X_i)$, $i=1,\dots,n+1$. Use Q1 part (d) to argue that each
  $U_i \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0,1)$. Then use the result from part (b) of this
  question.  

\item Use part (c) to show that the split conformal prediction result
  \eqref{eq:coverage_beta_split} holds whenever the distribution of each
  conformity score $V(X_i,Y_i)$ is continuous.  
  \marginpar{\small [2 pts]}

\item Show that the result in part (c) still holds when the CDF $F$ is not 
  necessarily continuous, and therefore the result in
  \eqref{eq:coverage_beta_split} holds in general, even when each $V(X_i,Y_i)$
  does not have a continuous distribution (and ties can occur with positive
  probability).  
  \marginpar{\small [3 pts]}

  Hint: using Q1 part (b), argue that you we replace each $X_i$ with $Q(U_i)$,
  where $Q$ denotes the quantile function associated with $F$, and $U_i$, 
  $i=1,\dots,n$ are i.i.d.\ from $\mathrm{Unif}(0,1)$. Then use the fact that
  $Q$ is itself nondecreasing.

\item Carry out a simulation to empirically verify
  \eqref{eq:coverage_beta_split} for split conformal prediction. You may fix
  $\alpha$, but examine a few different values of the calibration set size
  $n_2$.
