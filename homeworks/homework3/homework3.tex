\section{Carath\'{e}odory's view on sparsity of lasso solutions [10 points]} 

In this exercise, we will prove the fact we cited in lecture about sparsity of
lasso solutions, by invoking Caratheodory's theorem. Let $Y \in \R^n$ be a
response vector, $X \in \R^{n \times d}$ be a predictor matrix, and consider
the lasso estimator defined by solving
\[
\minimize_\beta \; \frac{1}{2} \|Y - X\beta\|_2^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|_1,
\]
for a tuning parameter $\lambda > 0$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Let \smash{$\hbeta$} be any solution to the lasso problem. Let
  \smash{$\hat\alpha = \hbeta / \|\hbeta\|_1$}. Prove that \smash{$X
    \hat\alpha$} lies in the convex hull of the vectors 
  \marginpar{\small [2 pts]}
  \[
  \{ \pm X_j \}_{j=1}^d.
  \]
  Note: here $X_j \in \R^n$ denotes the $j\th$ column of $X$.

\item Recall that Carath\'{e}odory's theorem states the following: given any set 
  $C \subseteq \R^k$, every element in its convex hull $\conv(C)$ can be 
  represented as a convex combination of $k+1$ elements of $C$. 

  Use this theorem and part (a) to prove that there exists a lasso solution
  \smash{$\tilde\beta$} with at most $n+1$ nonzero coefficients.  
  \marginpar{\small [2 pts]}

  Hint: start with a generic solution \smash{$\hbeta$}, and use
  Carath\'{e}odory's theorem to construct a coefficient vector
  \smash{$\tilde\beta$} such that (i) the fit is the same, \smash{$X\tilde\beta
    = X\hbeta$}; (ii) the penalty is at worst the same,
  \smash{$\|\tilde\beta\|_1 \leq \|\hbeta\|_1$}; and (iii)
  \smash{$X\tilde\beta$} is a nonnegative linear combination of at most $n+1$ of
  $\pm X_j$, $j=1,\dots,d$.  
 
\item Now, assuming $\lambda>0$, use the subgradient optimality condition for 
  the lasso problem to prove that the fit \smash{$X\tilde\beta$} from part (b)
  is supported on a subset of 
 \marginpar{\small [3 pts]}
  \[
  \{ \pm X_j \}_{j=1}^d
  \]
  that has affine dimension at most $n-1$.

  Hint: this is similar to the proof of Proposition 1 in the lasso lecture
  notes. Assume that \smash{$X\tilde\beta$} is a nonnegative combination of 
  exactly $n+1$ of $\pm X_j$, $j=1,\dots,d$. Then one of these $n+1$ vectors, 
  denote it by $s_i X_i$ (where \smash{$s_i = \sign(\tilde\beta_i)$}) can be
  written as a linear combination of the others. Take an inner product with the
  lasso residual and use the subgradient optimality condition for the lasso to
  prove that the coefficients in this linear combination must sum to 1, and
  therefore, $s_i X_i$ is actually an affine combination of the others. Notice
  that this shows the affine span of the $n+1$ vectors in question is
  $(n-1)$-dimensional.     

\item A refinement of Carath\'{e}odory's is as follows: given a set $C \subseteq
  \R^k$, every element in its convex hull $\conv(C)$ can be represented as a
  convex combination of $r+1$ elements of $C$, where $r$ is the affine dimension
  of $\conv(C)$. 

 Use this theorem and part (c) to prove that there exists a lasso solution
  \smash{$\check\beta$} with at most $n$ nonzero coefficients.

\section{Variance of least squares in nonlinear feature models [15 points]} 

\def\asto{\overset{\mathrm{as}}{\to}}
\def\hSigma{\hat\Sigma}

In this exercise, we will examine the variance of least squares (in the
underparametrized regime) and min-norm least squares (in the overparametrized 
regime) in nonlinear feature models. Recall for a response vector $Y \in \R^n$
and feature matrix $X \in \R^{n \times d}$, the min-norm least squares estimator 
\smash{$\hbeta = (X^\T X/n)^+ X^\T Y/n$} has a variance component of its
out-of-sample prediction risk (conditional on $X$) given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ridgeless_var}
\Var_X(\hbeta) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \tr (\hSigma^+ \Sigma).
\end{equation}
Here \smash{$\hSigma = X^\T X/n$}, and $\Sigma = \Cov(x_i)$, for an arbitrary
row $x_i$ of $X$ (the rows all have the same distribution). Also, $\sigma^2 =
\Var(y_i | x_i)$ is the noise variance. In lecture, we studied a linear feature 
model of the form    
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:linear_features}
X = Z \Sigma^{1/2},
\end{equation}
for a covariance matrix $\Sigma \in \R^{d \times d}$ and a random matrix $Z \in
\R^{n \times d}$ that has i.i.d.\ entries with mean zero and unit variance. When
$\Sigma = I$, which we will assume throughout this homework problem, recall that
we proved that the variance \eqref{eq:ridgeless_var} satisfies, under standard 
random matrix theory conditions, as $n,d \to \infty$ and $d/n \to \gamma \in 
(0,\infty)$, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ridgeless_var_iso_limit}
\Var_X(\hbeta) \asto 
\begin{cases}
\sigma^2 \frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma} & \text{for $\gamma < 1$} \\ 
\sigma^2 \frac{1}{\gamma-1} & \text{for $\gamma > 1$}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
(The result for $\gamma < 1$ actually holds regardless of $\Sigma$.) Instead, we
can consider a nonlinear feature model of the form 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nonlinear_features}
X = \varphi(Z \Gamma^{1/2} W^\T),
\end{equation}
for a covariance matrix $\Gamma \in \R^{k \times k}$, and a random matrix $Z \in
\R^{n \times k}$ as before (except with $k$ in place of $d$). Moreover, now $W
\in \R^{d \times k}$ is a matrix of i.i.d.\ $N(0,1/k)$ entries, and $\varphi :
\R \to \R$ is a nonlinear function---called the activation function in a neural
network context---that we interpret to act elementwise on its input. 

There turns to be an uncanny connection between the asymptotic variance in
linear and nonlinear feature models, which will you uncover via simulation in
this homework problem. Attach your code as an appendix to this homework.  

\emph{***Note: for parts (a)--(d) below, just consider isotropic features, so
  that $\Sigma = I$ in \eqref{eq:ridgeless_var} and \eqref{eq:linear_features},
  and $\Gamma = I$ in \eqref{eq:nonlinear_features}.***}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Fix $n=200$, and let $d=[\gamma n]$ over a wide range of values for
  $\gamma$ (make sure your range covers both $\gamma<1$ and $\gamma>1$). 
  each $n,d$, draw $X$ from the linear feature model \eqref{eq:linear_features}
  and your choice of distribution for the entries of $Z$. Compute the
  finite-sample variance \eqref{eq:ridgeless_var}, and plot it, as a function of
  $\gamma$, on top of the asymptotic variance curve
  \eqref{eq:ridgeless_var_iso_limit}. To get a general idea of what this should
  look like, refer back to Figure 2 in the overparametrization lecture notes.      
  \marginpar{\small [3 pts]}

\item For the same values of $n,d$, and $k=100$, draw $X$ from the nonlinear
  feature model \eqref{eq:nonlinear_features}, for three different choices of
  $\varphi$:   
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
  \item $\varphi(x) = a_1\tanh(x)$;
  \item $\varphi(x) = a_2(x_+-b_2)$;
  \item $\varphi(x) = a_3(|x|-b_3)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Here $a_1,a_2,b_2,a_3,b_3$ are constants that you must choose to meet the 
  standardization conditions $\E[\varphi(G)]=0$ and $\E[\varphi(G)^2]=1$, for 
  $G \sim N(0,1)$. Produce a plot just as in part (a), with the finite-sample
  variances for choice of each activation function plotted in a different color,
  on top of the asymptotic variance curve \eqref{eq:ridgeless_var_iso_limit} for  
  the linear model case. Comment on what you find: do the nonlinear
  finite-sample variances lie close to the asymptotic variance for the linear
  model case?  
  \marginpar{\small [9 pts]}

\item Now use a linear activation function $\phi(x) = ax-b$, and create a plot
  as in part (b) with the same settings (same values of $n,d,k$, and so
  on). What behavior do the finite-sample variances have as a function of 
  $\gamma$? Is this surprising to you? Explain why what you are seeing is
  happening. 
 \marginpar{\small [3 pts]}

\item As a bonus, in light of part (c), elaborate on why the results in part (b)
  are remarkable. 

\item As another (large) bonus, rerun the analysis in this entire problem but
  with a non-isotropic covariance $\Sigma$ in \eqref{eq:linear_features}, and
  $\Gamma$ in \eqref{eq:nonlinear_features}. Extra bonus points if you properly
  recompute the asymptotic variance curves. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implicit regularization buffet: choose your dish [15 points]} 

In this exercise, you get to choose between multiple options for studying
implicit regularization. To be clear, each part (a), (b), and (c) below are
worth equal points, and you only have to choose one (bonus points for doing more
than one). 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Given any response vector $Y \in \R^n$ and feature matrix $X \in \R^{n
    \times d}$, let \smash{$\hbeta^{\mathrm{rg}}(\lambda)$} denote the ridge
  estimator, which solves  
  \[
  \minimize_\beta \; \|Y - X\beta\|_2^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|_2^2,
  \]
  for a tuning parameter $\lambda \geq 0$, and \smash{$\hbeta^{\mathrm{gf}}_t$}
  denote the gradient flow estimator, which solves 
  \[
  \dot\beta(t) = X^\T (Y - X\beta(t)),
  \]
  over time $t \geq 0$, subject to the initial condition $\beta(0)=0$. Prove
  that these two satisfy the relationship, for any $\lambda \geq 0$:
  \[
  \hbeta^{\mathrm{rg}}(\lambda) = \E[ \hbeta^{\mathrm{gf}}(T_\lambda) ], \quad 
  \text{$T_\lambda \sim \mathrm{Exp}(1/\lambda)$},
  \]
  where $\mathrm{Exp}(\mu)$ denotes the exponential distribution with mean
  $\mu$. In other words, if we stop gradient flow at a random time that
  fluctuates around $1/\lambda$, then on average it will look like ridge with 
  tuning parameter $\lambda$.

  Hint: there are two ways to prove this. Either way starts by having you make
  the observation that for a function $g$, its Laplace transform evaluated at a
  $\lambda$, denoted $\cL\{g\}(\lambda)$, can be written in terms of an
  expectation of $g$ with respect to the $\mathrm{Exp}(1/\lambda)$ distribution.
  Then you have two paths you can pursue. The first path is to write down the 
  explicit forms for the ridge and gradient flow solutions, and relate them
  using Laplace transforms. The second path is to start with the differential
  equation that defines gradient flow and take Laplace transforms, then relate
  this to the optimality conditions for ridge. Either way you will have to read
  up a little bit on Laplace transforms if you don't know much about them
  already. 

\item We saw in the ridge regression lecture that we can view the ridge
  estimator in terms of the min-norm least squares estimator on an augmented
  feature set, where we append a growing number of random features (independent
  of the response and given features) with suitably shrinking variance. Conduct
  a comprehensive simulation suite to (i) validate that this fact appears to be
  true for a very large number of auxiliary features, and (ii) investigate the
  speed of convergence: what happens as you vary the number of auxiliary
  features, down to a moderate or even small number? 

  Then, extend your simulations study to examine what happens when you use an
  augmented feature set (by appending random features) in other interpolating
  estimators, like the minimum $\ell_1$ norm least squares estimator, or a
  neural network. Describe what you find. Does anything interesting come out?     

\item Conduct a literature search to identify an interesting example of implicit
  regularization in statistics or machine learning that is new---new just
  meaning that we did not cover it in class. This could be an example that is
  studied theoretically, or one that arises from methods or algorithms that are
  popular in practice. Describe in reasonable detail (1-2 pages) what is known
  about this example of implicit regularization.
